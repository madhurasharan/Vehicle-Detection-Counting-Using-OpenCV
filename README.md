# Vehicle Detection and Counting using OpenCV 🚗📹

A real-time system to detect and count vehicles using computer vision techniques. This project leverages OpenCV to process video feeds and track vehicles as they cross a predefined line, enabling efficient traffic analysis and monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects and counts vehicles crossing a virtual line in video footage
- Real-time processing using OpenCV
- Simple and interactive web interface for video upload and results
- Frame-by-frame analysis with object tracking

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Flask (for the web interface)
- HTML, CSS (Frontend)
